# Coffeeware License

### A software license made for programmers

According to the internet:

> ***Programmer:*** a tool which converts caffeine into code

Hence, the coffeeware license had to be released to the public, there you go:

    **"THE COFFEEWARE LICENSE" (Revision 2):**
    
    <[@Nickname][1]> wrote this code. As long as you retain this notice you
    can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think 
    this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a coffee in return. 
    
    Also, you might consider following me on [social network][2] for any comments and/or 
    questions you might have and if you'd like you can send me a donation 
    at any time to support my work, ask me how!

This repo contains the license in **.md** format and a badge in **.png** format. Feel free to use this license in your own projects and tell others about it.

Cheers!
